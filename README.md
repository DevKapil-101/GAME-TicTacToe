# TIC TAC TOE GAME ❌⭕️❌⭕️

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Java Swing. The game allows two players to take turns and tries to find a winner based on the classic Tic Tac Toe rules.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns, with player 1 using "X" and player 0 using "O".
- The goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the opponent does.
- If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the `myGame` class to start the game.
2. The game window will appear with a 3x3 grid and a clock showing the current time.
3. Player 1 starts with "X" by clicking on an empty cell.
4. Player 2 (computer) will play automatically with "O".
5. The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
6. After the game is over, a message dialog will appear, asking if you want to play again.
   - Click "Yes" to start a new game.
   - Click "No" to exit the game.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
